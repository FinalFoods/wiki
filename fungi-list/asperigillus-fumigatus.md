# Asperigillus fumigatus

### Occurrence
![Aspergillus Fumigatus](/uploads/aspergillus-fumigatus.jpg "Aspergillus Fumigatus")

*Asperigillus fumigatus* is widespread in nature and it is typically found in soil and decaying organic matter, such as compost heaps, where it plays an essential role in carbon and nitrogen recycling. Colonies of the fungus produce from conidiophores; thousands of minute grey-green conidia (2–3 μm) which readily become airborne. *Asperigillus fumigatus* occurs in areas with widely different climates and environments.

The fungus is capable of growth at 37 °C or 99 °F (normal human body temperature), and can grow at temperatures up to 50 °C or 122 °F, with conidia surviving at 70 °C or 158 °F conditions it regularly encounters in self-heating compost heaps. Its spores are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, and everybody inhales an estimated several hundred spores each day; typically, these are quickly eliminated by the immune system in healthy individuals. 

*Aspergillus fumigatus* grown on certain building materials can produce mycotoxins.

### Risk group RG2
*Asperigillus fumigatus*  is the main agent of aspergillosis in patients with impaired natural immunity. The species causes a typical inhalation mycosis, whereby colonization and invasion are generally accompanied by allergic reactions. Particularly low-level white cells patients, transplant patients, patients under intensive care, patients with chronic liver disease and patients with chronic granulomatous disease are at risk, but  cases are also reported in patients without apparent underlying disease.

Dissemination may occur in apparently healthy individuals, but more often after chronic lung disorders with steroid treatment. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) often occurs among patients with residual tuberculosis or with <50 CD4 cells⋅µL-1, while those with CD4 <100 cells⋅µL-1 are at risk . Extracorporal oxygenation is a risk factor. Also mild asthma can be a risk factor. Disseminated infections in patients without apparent immune disorder are extremely rare  

The species occurs commonly in external ears and is one of the prevalent agents of fungal sinusitis, particularly in North America. Sinusitis may be allergic, lead to fungus balls. In the latter case, complication may occur which may be cranial and life-threatening. Also endocarditis has been reported in patients without risk factors. However, infection may have taken place during earlier periods of surgery, steroid use, application of antibiotics or other debilitating factors such as diabetes, while underlying diseases may initially be inapparent. Due to the large-scale use of azoles in agriculture, azole-resistant clones are emerging in Europe and Asia. Nosocomial infections in immunocompromised patients may be due to hygiene problems or construction works.

The species natural occurrence is in rotten plant material at higher temperatures; it is abundant in the air during biological waste treatment.

Other names used for *Asperigillus fumigatus* are 

*Cephalosporium acremonium*, and *Sarocladium strictum*.
