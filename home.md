# Micro-organisms in the home
## Fungi
Of the over 100,000 described species of fungi, about 100 are known to be of medical relevance regularly involved in human and animal mycoses, and another 600 are repeatedly or occasionally observed as opportunists and possibly causing infections in immunocompromised people.

## Nomenclature
In the lists in this wiki, the risk group (RG) of each micro-organism are indicated whenever available from a reliable source. Risk Groups are classifications that describe the relative hazard posed by infectious agents or toxins in the laboratory.

The [NIH Guidelines](https://www.phe.gov/s3/BioriskManagement/biosafety/Pages/Risk-Groups.aspx) defines the risk groups as:

* Risk Group 1 (RG1) - Agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans. This group includes a list of animal viral etiologic agents in common use. These agents represent no or little risk to an individual and no or little risk to the community.

* Risk Group 2 (RG2) - Agents that are associated with human disease which is rarely serious and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often available. These agents represent a moderate risk to an individual but a low risk to the community.

* Risk Group 3 (RG3) - Agents that are associated with serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions may be available. These agents represent a high risk to an individual but a low risk to the community.

* Risk Group 4 (RG4) - Agents that are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are not usually available. These agents represent a high risk to the individual and a high risk to the community.
