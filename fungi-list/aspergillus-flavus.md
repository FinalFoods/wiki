*Aspergillus flavus* is a pathogenic fungus with a world-wide distribution. It is best known for its colonization of cereal grains, legumes, and tree nuts. 

*Aspergillus flavus* colonies are commonly powdery masses of yellow-green spores on the upper surface and reddish-gold on the lower surface. In both grains and legumes, infection is minimized to small areas, and discoloration and dullness of affected areas is often seen. Growth is rapid and colonies appear downy or powdery in texture.


### Risk group RG1
*Aspergillus flavus*  is one of the main agents of human allergic bronchial aspergillosis and of pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients where its pathology may be aggravated by the production of mycotoxins. It also occurs in external ears and may be involved in otitis occasionally with severe complications. Reported cases of chronic invasive sinusitis; it is the main agent of chronic invasive sinusitis worldwide, particularly in arid climate zones. The species is also one of the common agents of mycotic sinusitis. Cutaneous infections or keratitis are rare, and their etiology needs to be proven by additional methods. Ahmed et al. (2015a) used immunohistochemistry to establish etiology in a case of mycetoma.

*Aspergillus flavus* is unique in that it is a thermotolerant fungus, so can survive at temperatures that other fungi cannot. A. flavus can contribute to the storage rots, especially when the plant material is stored at high moisture levels. A. flavus grows and thrives in hot and humid climates.
